        Michelin-star restaurants are pricey! Imagine wasting all that money on something you didn't
        even like, something you weren't expecting, or something that you're allergic to! At Michelin Eats
        we want to offer you a way to check out these high class restaurants' menus, which include images
        and possible allergens! We even have a ratings system where you can read the opinions of other fine
        diners. Wow!
      </p>
